# FocusTime app

This app allows you to set aside time to do specific things so that you can focus on them. Once you enter the name of the activity you plan to do, a timer will start and the phone will vibrate at the end of the time. It will also track the activities that you have previously recorded and indicate with red (incomplete) and green (complete) colors the state of completion of those activities. Based on the FocusTime app from the Udemy course "React Native in 2021: Zero to Mastery [With Hooks]".
